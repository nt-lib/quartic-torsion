we now verify Claim 1, this produces the CC (congruence conditions) values in 
Table 1.
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 25 using p= 3 are:
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 26 using p= 7 are:
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 28 using p= 5 are:
q has to be congruent to 1 modulo  4
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 30 using p= 7 are:
q has to be congruent to 1 modulo  6
q has to be congruent to 1 modulo  3
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 32 using p= 3 are:
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 34 using p= 3 are:
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 36 using p= 5 are:
q has to be congruent to 1 modulo  4
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 42 using p= 11 are:
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 20 using p= 7 are:
The congruence conditions coming from degree 3 points for n= 24 using p= 5 are:
q has to be congruent to 1 modulo  4
Now we verify Claim 2 for the pairs (n,p) where there are degree 2 points on 
Y_{F_p}
The congruence conditions coming from degree 2 points for n= 26 using p= 7 are:
The congruence conditions coming from degree 2 points for n= 28 using p= 5 are:
n= 28 , q has to be congruent to 1 modulo  4
The congruence conditions coming from degree 2 points for n= 30 using p= 7 are:
n= 30 , q has to be congruent to 1 modulo  6
n= 30 , q has to be congruent to 1 modulo  3
The congruence conditions coming from degree 2 points for n= 42 using p= 11 are:
The congruence conditions coming from degree 2 points for n= 20 using p= 7 are:
